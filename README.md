# KindPath Website

A Next.js landing page for KindPath Collective, showcasing the KindEarth platform for ethical social-policy forecasting and community-led pilots.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Build

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you want a quieter build (skips lint and typecheck output), run:

```bash
npm run build:quiet
```

To run type checking separately (recommended for CI):

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

## Lint

To run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```
